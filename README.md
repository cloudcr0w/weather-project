# WEATHER-PROJECT :cloud:

WELCOME to the WEATHER-PROJECT  
:construction: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** :construction:

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

This repository showcases a **serverless application** that periodically fetches weather data from a public API, stores it in the cloud, processes the information, and (in future iterations) visualizes the results.

## KEY AWS SERVICES

- **AWS Lambda** – Cyclical data fetching and processing
- **Amazon EventBridge** – Triggers Lambda on a schedule (e.g., once daily)
- **Amazon S3** – Stores raw CSV/JSON data
- **DynamoDB / RDS** – Holds processed data
- **AWS Amplify (Gen1)** or **S3 + CloudFront** – Hosts a frontend for data visualization
- **GitHub** – Version control & project history

## PROJECT STATUS

I am currently **building** the data pipeline and functionalities. Expect frequent commits and updates as I refine the process.

## CONTRIBUTION & FEEDBACK

Feedback is always welcome! Feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request** with any suggestions or improvements.
