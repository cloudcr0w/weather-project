# WEATHER-PROJECT :cloud:

WELCOME to the WEATHER-PROJECT - Serverless application fetching daily weather data, storing it in AWS, and serving it via API + frontend
:construction: **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** :construction:
https://main.d24ky3ld7v2sml.amplifyapp.com

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

This repository showcases a **serverless application** that periodically fetches weather data from a public API, stores it in the cloud, processes the information, and (in future iterations) visualizes the results.
This project uses the **OpenWeather API (free plan)**, which allows fetching weather data **once per day** due to rate limits. If you want to run this project with your own API key, you will need to register on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### Wroc≈Çaw Weather App

This is a simple serverless  weather application showcasing the current weather data for Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeather API and is updated once a day. Structure is : html, css, js, python files. The app includes additional features such as:

- **Daily weather updates** (Wroc≈Çaw, Poland)  
- **Events & Gallery**: extra city info for demo frontend  
- **Responsive frontend** (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- **Continuous Deployment** with AWS Amplify  

- **Continuous Deployment with AWS Amplify**
This project is hosted and continuously deployed using AWS Amplify. Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically built and deployed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set up environment variables
This project uses environment variables stored in a .env file.

Recommended method: Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
Open .env and replace placeholder values with your own API keys and AWS settings.
Alternatively, you can manually create a .env file in the project root and add:
```sh
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name_here
TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here
```
Or export them as environment variables:
```sh
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name_here
export TABLE_NAME=your_table_name_here
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
Backend (Python):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Frontend (Node.js):

cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run backend locally
Get Weather Data
```sh
python lambda/get_weather/main.py
```
Analyze Weather Data
```sh
python lambda/analyze_weather/analyze_data.py
